* Funky Launcher *

This is a demonstration project to show how simply the Android stock launcher can be modified. This example changes the desktop background based on whether or not WiFi is on.

In order to compile this you also need to include the Launcher Support project (https://github.com/FunkyAndroid/FunkyLauncherSupport) which provides classes which are not part of the SDK, but are available on Android 4.0.3 and 4.0.4.
